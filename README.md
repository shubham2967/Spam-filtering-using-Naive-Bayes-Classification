<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The task is to implement a relatively simple spam filter.  We will use a small data set to train and test the model</p> 
    
<p>The messages within the datasets have already been classified as ham (not spam), or spam. </p> 

<p>The implementation of a Na√Øve Bayes Spam Filter is relatively straight forward using scikit-learn, however, this library hides the implementation details (and many solutions are available on the Internet).  Therefore, we are not going to use it.</p> 
<p>Bayes Theorem can give us the probability that a message is spam S for a given event E</p>

<h1>
$P\left(S\middle|\ E\right)=\frac{P\left(E\middle|\ S\right)P\left(S\right)}{P\left(E\middle|\ S\right)P\left(S\right)+P\left(E|\lnot S\right)P\left(\lnot S\right)}$
</h1>

<p>Where:</p>
<p>$P\left(S\middle|\ E\right)$, the probability that the message is spam given the event occurred.</p>
<p>$P\left(S\right)$, the prior probability that a message is spam.</p>
<p>$P\left(\lnot S\right)$, the prior probability that a message is not spam.  </p>

Note:  $P\left(S\right)$ and $P\left(\lnot S\right)$ are prior values, or prior beliefs.  This value could be calculated using the number of spam and number of ham classifications in the data set.  we could also use arbitrary values, for example; we could assume that of all email messages sent, 80% of them are spam and 20% of them are not spam.  The success of the filter depends on the prior values.

<p>$P\left(E\middle|\ S\right)$, the probability that event E occurs in a spam emails.</p>

<p>$P\left(E|\lnot S\right)$, the probability that event E occurs in non-spam emails.</p>
